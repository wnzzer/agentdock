//! Assets carried inside the executable so a release is one file.
//!
//! Two kinds, for two reasons:
//!
//! - The web build is served straight from memory; nothing has to exist on disk.
//! - The native bridges are Node ES modules that run as child processes, so they
//!   cannot stay in memory. They are written next to the server's own state on
//!   startup, replaced only when their contents differ.
//!
//! In debug builds `rust-embed` reads from the source tree instead, so editing
//! the web app or a bridge during development does not need a rebuild.
//! `AGENTDOCK_WEB_DIR` and `AGENTDOCK_NATIVE_BRIDGE` still override both, which
//! is what an installed layout or a packaging test uses.
