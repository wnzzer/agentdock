//! What differs between the agent clients AgentDock drives, in one place.
//!
//! Everything the server does with a client goes through its adapter: where
//! its binary comes from, how a launch reaches an endpoint, which permission
//! modes it offers, how its model list is read, how its account signs in, and
//! where its transcripts are and how they read. The rest of the server asks
//! the adapter and never names a client, so adding one is a file here and an
//! entry in `adapter`.
